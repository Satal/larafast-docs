## Installation

To install the project you need to open your terminal and type these commands

### Clone repo and install composer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karakhanyans-tools/larafast.git [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
cd [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
composer install
```

### Create .env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Create APP_KEY

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### Run migrations

<Tip>
    By default DB_CONNECTION is set to SQLite, feel free to change it to MySQL or any preferred DB.
</Tip>

To use MySQL as a database, update the .env file with the new database credentials.

```bash .env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_db_name
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Install NPM and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Run Local Server

Laravel comes with a handy artisan serve command to run a local server. Feel free to use Valet or any other local server management tools.

```bash
php artisan serve
```

That's it. Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) and see your website!
