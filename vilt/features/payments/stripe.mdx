### Connect Stripe to Project

1. Create a [Stripe Account](https://stripe.com/) and do the initial setup.

### Setup API Keys

To connect Stripe to the LaraFast project you need to set API keys.&#x20;

1. Copy Publishable and Secret Keys from [Developers->API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. In your .env file replace the following keys

```dotenv .env
STRIPE_KEY=publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET=secret_key
```

### Subscriptions

To automate subscription creation from the project to Stripe, we have created a command that will create Stripe Products and Prices for you and save you all the hassle. No more manual subscriptions and price setups. (It also can be re-run in case anything changes, to sync the changes to Stripe)

1. In the project, open `/stubs/stripe/products.json`;

It contains example products. Modify the IDs and names of the products to meet your requirements.

2. Next, is Prices (Plans). Open `/stubs/stripe/prices.json`

In `prices.json` you will see the list of example prices. Change the data accordingly.

### Columns Explained

Price->ID - It's the name that you will use for checkout, basically it's stripe\_id for the price

Price->Amount - Stripe uses the lowest point for currency, for EUR and USD it's cents, and the amount should also be specified accordingly: `amount: 999` means the product price is **$9.99**

Price->billing\_scheme - Can be `per_unit` or `tiered`

Price->Product - This should be the product->id from products.json for which the price will be created.

To learn more about available columns and settings, check [Stripe API Docs for Price Object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create)

#### Create Products and Prices

After you made your changes and added all your products and prices, run the following artisan command to push all the data to Stripe:

```bash
php artisan stripe:create-products-and-prices
```

If you want to modify a product or plan, change them in .json files and rerun the command.

In the project `resources/js/Components/Plans.vue` update plan->slug with the ID of your price and that's it! :rocket:

### Checkout URL

```php web.php
Route::get('subscription-checkout/{price}', [StripeController::class, 'subscriptionCheckout'])->name('subscription.checkout');
```

You are ready to accept payments and get subscriptions!

### Single Payment Products

If your project does not have subscriptions but has single-payment products, we've got you covered here too.&#x20;

Check `/stubs/stripe/single_payment_products.json`

Do your changes and run:

```bash
php artisan stripe:create-single-payment-products
```

For single payment prices stripe is not accepting "id", it is autogenerating. To accept single payments check your freshly generated prices in Stripe ( [https://dashboard.stripe.com/products](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products?active=true))->your product and use Price->API ID (e.g. price\_1OcPptFocfJlGF71c5uS2xjs )

### Checkout URL

```php web.php
Route::get('product-checkout/{price}', [StripeController::class, 'productCheckout'])->name('product.checkout');
```

***

### Stripe URL's

LaraFast comes with stripe subscription and product checkout URLs, which you can find in **routes/web.php**

```php web.php
Route::prefix('stripe')->name('stripe.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('subscription-checkout/{price}', [StripeController::class, 'subscriptionCheckout'])->name('subscription.checkout');
    // If your product checkout does not require auth user,
    // move this part outside "auth:sanctum" middleware and change the logic inside method
    Route::get('product-checkout/{price}', [StripeController::class, 'productCheckout'])->name('product.checkout');
    Route::get('success', [StripeController::class, 'success'])->name('success');
    Route::get('error', [StripeController::class, 'error'])->name('error');
    Route::get('billing', [StripeController::class, 'billing'])->name('billing'); // Redirects to Customer Portal
});
```

### Middleware

Use pre-defined `Http/Middleware/Subscribed` middleware for subscription-protected routes.

```php web.php
Route::middleware([Subscribed::class])->group(function () {
    // Add endpoints that are only for subscribed users
});
```

## Customer Portal and Emails

1. [Turn on Customer Emals](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) for successful payments and refunds

3. [Turn on the Customer Portal ](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal)to allow users to manage their subscriptions, and payment methods and see invoices
4. If you have subscriptions, make sure to allow users to switch plans and choose prices that are switchable

[//]: # (<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/CleanShot 2024-02-16 at 08.24.22@2x.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Customer Portal Subscriptions</p></figcaption></figure>)

5. [Customize your Customer Portal ](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding)with your brand image and colors

To redirect users to their Customer Portal use /billing route

```bash web.php
Route::get('billing', [StripeController::class, 'billing'])->name('billing'); // Redirects to Customer Portal
```

## Webhooks

Laravel Cashier automatically handles the following webhooks out of the box:

```bash
customer.subscription.created
customer.subscription.updated
customer.subscription.deleted
customer.updated
customer.deleted
payment_method.automatically_updated
invoice.payment_action_required
invoice.payment_succeeded
```

To create your webhooks, run:&#x20;

```bash
php artisan cashier:webhook
```

This command will use your APP\_URL to generate a webhook URL in Stripe. If you want to modify it, use:

```bash
php artisan cashier:webhook --url "https://example.com/stripe/webhook"
```

If you need to add some credits to the user's profile or make some changes to his account after a certain webhook, you can do that in `app/Listeners/StripeEventListener.php`

<Tip>
For local testing, you can use [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli)
</Tip>

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to https://example.com/stripe/webhook
```

or

```bash
stripe listen --forward-to http://127.0.0.1:8000/stripe/webhook
```
