Larafast comes with [Spatie Laravel Permission](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/v6/introduction) package pre-installed. This package allows you to manage user roles and permissions in your Laravel application.

<Note>
    If you have updated your exising Larafast project, make sure to run migrations to add the necessary tables to your database.

## Usage

### Creating Roles

There are two ways to create roles in your application:

1. Using RoleSeeder.php

database/seeders/RoleSeeder.php file contains two pre-defined roles: `user` and `admin`

Run seeder command to add these roles to the database:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=RoleSeeder
```

2. Using Admin Dashboard

You can also create roles using the Admin Dashboard. Visit `/admin/roles` route in your browser and click on the "New Role" button.

### Creating Permissions

Permissions can be created in a similar way:

1. Using PermissionSeeder.php

database/seeders/PermissionSeeder.php file contains a few pre-defined permissions

Run seeder command to add these permissions to the database:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=PermissionSeeder
```

2. Using Admin Dashboard

You can also create permissions using the Admin Dashboard. Visit `/admin/permissions` route in your browser and click on the "New Permission" button.

### Assigning Roles and Permissions

Roles and permissions can be assigned to users using the Admin Dashboard.

1. Visit `/admin/users` route in your browser

2. Click on the "Edit" button next to the user you want to assign roles/permissions to

3. Click on the "Roles" or "Permissions" tab and assign the desired roles/permissions

### Middleware

You can protect routes using the `role` and `permission` middleware provided by the Spatie Laravel Permission package.

```php
Route::get('/admin', function () {
    //
})->middleware('role:admin');
```

```php
Route::get('/admin', function () {
    //
})->middleware('permission:edit articles');
```

### Scopes

The `HasRoles` trait also adds role and withoutRole scopes to your models to scope the query to certain roles or permissions:

```php
$users = User::role('writer')->get(); // Returns only users with the role 'writer'
$nonEditors = User::withoutRole('editor')->get(); // Returns only users without the role 'editor'
```

The role and `withoutRole` scopes can accept a string, a `\Spatie\Permission\Models\Role` object or an `\Illuminate\Support\Collection` object.

The same trait also adds scopes to only get users that have or don't have a certain permission.

```php
$users = User::permission('edit articles')->get(); // Returns only users with the permission 'edit articles' (inherited or directly)
$usersWhoCannotEditArticles = User::withoutPermission('edit articles')->get(); // Returns all users without the permission 'edit articles' (inherited or directly)
```

The scope can accept a string, a `\Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission` object or an `\Illuminate\Support\Collection` object.
