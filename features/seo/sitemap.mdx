### Setup

With Sitemap everything is also as easy as other components.

Run the following artisan command:

```bash
php artisan generate:sitemap
```

The command will generate a sitemap.xml in the public folder.

It uses `APP_URL` from config files to generate a sitemap.
If you want to generate a sitemap for your production locally, change the `$url` variable in the `app/Console/Commands/GenerateSitemap.php` file.

For more details about sitemap check the [spatie/laravel-sitemap](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-sitemap) package.
<Tip>
Don't forget to submit your sitemap.xml to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/) `{yourdomain}/sitemap.xml`
