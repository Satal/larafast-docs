LaraFast comes with SchemaOrg service, which will help to generate ld+json files for Schema.org markup. File: `app/Services/SchemaOrg.php`
It comes with predefined **Article**, **Organization**, and **Review** methods.

The `article` is already used for Blog articles.

The `organization` is used for the main configurations of the website.

Feel free to add any new types you want.&#x20;

Types are available here: [https://github.com/spatie/schema-org](https://github.com/spatie/schema-org)

### Organization

To set your organization data, update `/lang/en/schema.php` file with your data.

To share organization schema, uncomment `View::share` this line in AppServiceProvider.php

```php AppServiceProvider.php
/**
 * Bootstrap any application services.
 */
public function boot(): void
{
    //

    View::share(['schema' => ['organization' => app(SchemaOrg::class)->organization()]]);
}
```

<Tip>
To validate your Schema.org markup use [https://validator.schema.org/](https://validator.schema.org/)
</Tip>

### Examples

To update or add more schema.org markups, add them in `/views/schema.blade.php`
