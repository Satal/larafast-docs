The Changelog feature allows you to keep your users informed about updates, new features, and improvements in your application.

## Overview

The Changelog page displays a list of changes made to your application over time. Each changelog entry includes:

- Publication date
- Tags (optional)
- Detailed description

## Usage

### Viewing the Changelog

Users can access the Changelog page to see a chronological list of updates and changes to the application.

### Structure

Each changelog entry is presented in a card-like format with the following elements:

1. **Publication Date**: Displayed at the top of each entry in the format "Month Day, Year".
2. **Tags** (optional): Colorful badges indicating the type or category of the change.
3. **Description**: A detailed explanation of the changes, which can include formatted text and HTML.

## Implementation

### Backend

Changelog entries are stored in the database and retrieved using a controller. Each entry should have the following fields:

- `published_at`: The date when the changelog entry was published.
- `tags`: A comma-separated list of tags (optional).
- `description`: The main content of the changelog entry, which can include HTML.

### Frontend

The Changelog page is implemented using a Blade template (`resources/views/pages/changelog.blade.php`). It uses a responsive layout and is styled to match the overall design of the application.

#### Key Components

1. **Page Header**: Displays the title "Changelog" and a brief description.

2. **Changelog List**: Iterates through the `$changelogs` collection to display each entry.

3. **Entry Card**: Each changelog item is wrapped in a card-like container with:
   - Publication date
   - Tags (if present)
   - Description content

4. **Empty State**: If no changelog items are available, a message is displayed to inform the user.

## Customization

### Styling

The Changelog page uses utility classes for styling. You can customize the appearance by modifying these classes or adding custom CSS.

### Localization

The page supports localization. Key strings like "Changelog" and "See what's new in our app" use the `__()` helper for easy translation.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep your changelog up-to-date with all significant changes to your application.
2. **Clear Descriptions**: Write clear, concise descriptions for each change.
3. **Use Tags**: Categorize changes with tags to help users quickly identify the nature of each update.
4. **HTML in Descriptions**: You can use HTML in the description field for rich formatting, but ensure it's sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.
