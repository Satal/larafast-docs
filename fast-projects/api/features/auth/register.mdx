## Registration

For registration in Larafast API Boilerplate responsible `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php`.

The `store` method is the primary method in this controller. It handles incoming registration requests. The method accepts a `RegisterRequest` object, which encapsulates the validation rules for the registration data.

Here's a brief overview of the `store` method:

```php
public function store(RegisterRequest $request): JsonResponse
{
    $user = User::create([
        'name' => $request->name,
        'email' => $request->email,
        'password' => Hash::make($request->password),
    ]);

    event(new Registered($user));

    // Assign role to user if you have roles
    // $user->assignRole('user');

    return response()->token($user);
}
```

The `store` method performs the following steps:

1. It creates a new `User` instance using the validated data from the `RegisterRequest` object. The password is hashed before being stored in the database.

2. It fires a `Registered` event, passing the newly created user as the event's argument. This event can be used to perform actions after a user has been registered, such as sending a welcome email.

3. If roles are implemented in the application, a role can be assigned to the user at this point. This line is commented out in the provided code.

4. Finally, it returns a JSON response containing a token for the newly registered user. This token can be used for subsequent authenticated requests.

<Tip>
    To learn more about the `return response()->token($user);` method, refer to the [Response Macros](/fast-projects/api/extended/response-macro) section.
</Tip>
Remember, this is a basic implementation of a registration controller. Depending on the requirements of your application, you might need to add more functionality, such as email verification, role assignment, etc.
