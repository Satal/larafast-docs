This document describes the social authentication logic implemented in the PHP Laravel application using the Socialite package. The logic is primarily handled by the `SocialiteController` class.

## Redirecting to the OAuth Provider

The `redirect` method in the `SocialiteController` class is used to redirect the user to the OAuth provider. The method accepts a `driver` parameter which specifies the OAuth provider to use.

```php
public function redirect($driver)
{
    return Socialite::driver($driver)->stateless()->redirect();
}
```

## Handling Provider Callbacks

The `callback` method in the `SocialiteController` class is used to handle the callback from the OAuth provider. It retrieves the user details from the provider and creates or retrieves the corresponding user record in the application's database.

```php
public function callback($driver)
{
    $userData = Socialite::driver($driver)->stateless()->user();

    $user = User::firstOrCreate(['email' => $userData->getEmail()], [
        'name' => $userData->getName(),
        'password' => Hash::make(Str::random()),
    ]);

    $user->socialAccounts()->firstOrCreate(['account_id' => $userData->getId()], [
        'provider' => $driver,
        'token' => $userData->token,
    ]);

    return response()->token($user);
}
```

## Routes

The routes for social authentication are defined in the `routes/auth.php` file. The routes use the `SocialiteController` class, and the `redirect` and `callback` methods respectively. These routes are grouped under a middleware that ensures only guest users can access them.

```php
Route::middleware(['guest'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/auth/{driver}', [SocialiteController::class, 'redirect']);
    Route::get('/auth/{driver}/callback', [SocialiteController::class, 'callback']);
});
```

This concludes the overview of the social authentication logic in the application.
