This document describes the login logic implemented in the Larafast API Boilerplate. The logic is primarily handled by the `LoginController` class.

## Login Request Validation

The first step in the login process is validating the incoming request data. This is done using the `LoginRequest` class, which extends Laravel's `FormRequest` class. The `rules` method of this class specifies that both the `email` and `password` fields are required, and that the `email` field must be a valid email address.

```php
class LoginRequest extends FormRequest
{
    public function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            'email' => ['required', 'string', 'email'],
            'password' => ['required', 'string'],
        ];
    }
}
```

## User Authentication

The `store` method in the `LoginController` class handles the actual authentication. It retrieves the user record with the provided email address, and then uses Laravel's `Hash` facade to check if the provided password matches the hashed password stored in the database.

If the user record doesn't exist, or if the password doesn't match, a `ValidationException` is thrown with a message indicating that the authentication failed.

```php
public function store(LoginRequest $request): JsonResponse
{
    $user = User::where('email', $request->get('email'))->first();

    if (! $user || ! Hash::check($request->get('password'), $user->password)) {
        throw ValidationException::withMessages([
            'email' => [__('auth.failed')],
        ]);
    }

    return response()->token($user);
}
```

## Token Generation

If the authentication is successful, a token is generated for the user. This is done using the `token` macro defined in the `ResponseMacroServiceProvider` class. The token is then returned in the response.

```php
Response::macro('token', function ($user, $abilities = ['*']): JsonResponse {
    return Response::success(
        [
            'token' => $user->createToken(device(), $abilities)->plainTextToken,
            'user' => new UserResource($user),
        ],
    );
});
```

## Logout

The `destroy` method in the `LoginController` class handles logout. It deletes the current access token for the authenticated user, and then returns a success message.

```php
public function destroy(Request $request): JsonResponse
{
    $request->user()->currentAccessToken()->delete();

    return response()->successMessage('Successfully logged out');
}
```

## Routes

The routes for login and logout are defined in the `routes/auth.php` file. Both routes use the `LoginController` class, and the `store` and `destroy` methods respectively.

```php
Route::post('/login', [LoginController::class, 'store'])
    ->middleware('guest')
    ->name('login');

Route::post('/logout', [LoginController::class, 'destroy'])
    ->middleware('auth:sanctum')
    ->name('logout');
```

This concludes the overview of the login logic in the application.
