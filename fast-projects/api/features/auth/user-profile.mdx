description: This document describes the authenticated user logic implemented in the Larafast API Boilerplate. The logic is primarily handled by the `AuhUserController` class.

## Fetching Authenticated User

The `show` method in the `AuhUserController` class is used to fetch the authenticated user. It returns a `UserResource` instance for the authenticated user.

```php
public function show(Request $request)
{
    return new UserResource($request->user());
}
```

## Updating Authenticated User

The `update` method in the `AuhUserController` class is used to update the authenticated user's details. It accepts an `UpdateUserRequest` instance which validates the incoming request data. The `rules` method of this class specifies that the `name`, `email`, and `password` fields are optional, but if provided, they must meet certain criteria.

```php
public function update(UpdateUserRequest $request): UserResource
{
    $request->user()->update($request->validated());

    return new UserResource($request->user());
}
```

## Deleting Authenticated User

The `destroy` method in the `AuhUserController` class is used to delete the authenticated user. It deletes the authenticated user from the database and returns a success message.

```php
public function destroy(Request $request)
{
    $request->user()->delete();

    return response()->successMessage('User deleted successfully');
}
```

## Routes

The routes for fetching, updating, and deleting the authenticated user are defined in the `routes/auth.php` file. All these routes use the `AuhUserController` class, and the `show`, `update`, and `destroy` methods respectively. These routes are grouped under a middleware that ensures only authenticated users can access them.

```php
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/user', [AuhUserController::class, 'show']);
    Route::patch('/user', [AuhUserController::class, 'update']);
    Route::delete('/user', [AuhUserController::class, 'destroy']);
});
```

This concludes the overview of the authenticated user logic in the application.
