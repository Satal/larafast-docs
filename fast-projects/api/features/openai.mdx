## Introduction

To use OpenAI API in your application, you need to create an account on OpenAI and get the API key. You can get the API key from the OpenAI dashboard.

## Usage

To use OpenAI service, you can use OpenAIController which is already included in the package. You can use the following methods to interact with OpenAI API.

### For text completion
```php OpenAIController.php
public function completion(Request $request)
{
    return $this->openAIService->completion($request->get('prompt'), $request->get('model'));
}
```

### For text to speech

```php OpenAIController.php
public function textToSpeech(Request $request): PromiseInterface|Response
{
    return $this->openAIService->textToSpeech($request->get('text'));
}
```

### For image completion
```php OpenAIController.php
public function images(Request $request)
{
    return $this->openAIService->images($request->get('prompt'));
}
```
