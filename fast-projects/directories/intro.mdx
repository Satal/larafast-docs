## Installation

To install the project you need to open your terminal and type these commands

### Clone repo and install composer

```bash
git clone git@github.com:karakhanyans-tools/larafast-directories.git [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
cd [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
composer install
```

### Create .env file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Create APP_KEY just run:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### Change admin user details

Open the `database/seeders/AdminSeeder.php` file and update the default admin user details.

```php database/seeders/AdminSeeder.php
$user = User::create([
    'name' => 'Admin',
    'email' => 'admin@example.com',
    'password' => bcrypt('1111'),
]);

$user->assignRole('admin');
````

<Tip>
If you plan to use different roles, update the `database/seeders/RoleSeeder.php` file.
</Tip>

### Categories and Products

To modify pre-defined categories and products before running migrations, update the `database/seeders/CategorySeeder.php` and `database/seeders/ProductSeeder.php` files.

<Info>
    Details about how to manage categories can be found in [Categories](/fast-projects/directories/features/categories) documentation.
</Info>

### Run migrations

<Tip>
    By default DB_CONNECTION is set to SQLite, feel free to change it to MySQL or any preferred DB.
</Tip>

To use MySQL as a database, update the .env file with the new database credentials.

```bash .env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_db_name
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

Run the migrations and seed the database with the following command:
```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

or

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### Install NPM and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Run Local Server

Laravel comes with a handy artisan serve command to run a local server. Feel free to use Valet or any other local server management tools.

```bash
php artisan serve
```

That's it. Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) and see your website!

<Warning>
    Don't forget to remove the starter kit's git configs. To do so: `rm -rf .git` - to init fresh git folder later `git remote remove origin`
</Warning>
