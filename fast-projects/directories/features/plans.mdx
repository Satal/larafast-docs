Check out the [LemonSqueezy](/features/payments/lemonsqueezy) docs from Larafast for more details on how to create subscription plans and one-time payments.
</Tip>

After user submits the product, he will be redirected to the plans page where he can choose the plan he wants to subscribe to.
In the plans page user will see the plans that are created in LemonSqueezy or Stripe.

Plans page is a Livewire component that is located in `app/Livewire/Plans.php`.

Currently the plans page is configured to use LemonSqueezy, but you can easily switch to Stripe or Paddle.
For more details on how to switch to Stripe or Paddle, check out the [Stripe](/features/payments/stripe) or [Paddle](/features/payments/paddle) docs.
