### Accessing Admin Panel

For initial setup, change the admin email and password in `database/seeders/AdminSeeder.php`
file and run the seeder command to add to the database.

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=AdminSeeder
```

```php database/seeders/AdminSeeder.php
<?php
...
class AdminSeeder extends Seeder
{
    public function run(): void
    {
        $user = User::create([
            'name' => 'Admin',
            'email' => 'admin@example.com',
            'password' => bcrypt('1111'),
        ]);

        $user->assignRole('admin');
    }
}
```

Now you can access the admin panel by visiting `/admin` route in your browser.
