## Registration

To keep users registration simple and secure, I have implemented two ways of registration:

- Verification Code (only email needed)
- Google Auth

#### Verification Code

When user registers with verification code, he will receive an email with a verification code that he needs to enter in the registration form.

#### Google Auth

When user registers with Google Auth, he will be redirected to Google's login page where he can login with his Google account.

<Tip>
Check out the [Google Auth](/features/social-auth#google) docs for more details on how to setup Google Auth.

## Login

User can login with Magic Link or with Google Auth.

#### Magic Link

When user logs in with Magic Link, he will receive an email with a magic link that he needs to click to login.

#### Google Auth

When user logs in with Google Auth, he will be redirected to Google's login page where he can login with his Google account.
