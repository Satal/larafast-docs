description: How to integrate LemonSqueezy for non-auth users in Laravel
icon: 'lemon'
---

Laravel LemonSqueezy package default checkouts are made for only registered users, same for webhooks to save orders.&#x20;

To get product payment links and use them for non-auth users, you can use `app/Services/LemonSqueezyService.php` ( Remember to add LemonSqueezyServiceProvider::class to the config/app.php providers list)

LemonSqueezyService uses LemonSqueezyAPI -> [https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/api](https://docs.lemonsqueezy.com/api)

### Products

To retrieve the products, use the products() method from the Service,

```php
app(LemonSqueezyService::class)->products();
```

### Variants

For each product, you can retrieve its own variant by providing the product ID,

```php
public function variants($productId)
{
    return $this->client->get('variants?filter[product_id]='.$productId)->json();
}
```

### Products with no variants

If your product does not have any variants, in other words, if it has only one price, in the Product Object attributes you will see "buy\_now\_url" which can be used for checkout.

<Tip>
To apply the discount code in the checkout URL you can add the following after your URL

`?checkout[discount_code]=YOUR_DISCOUNT_CODE`
</Tip>

### Products with multiple variants

If the product has multiple variants, to create a checkout URL dynamically use the "checkout" method from the Service. The checkout method accepts variant ID and creates URL.

```php
public function checkout($variant)
{
    return $this->client->post('checkouts', [
        'data' => [
            'type' => 'checkouts',
            'attributes' => [
                'product_options' => array_filter([
                    'enabled_variants' => [(string) $variant],
                ]),
                'expires_at' => null,
            ],
            'relationships' => [
                'store' => [
                    'data' => [
                        'type' => 'stores',
                        'id' => $this->store,
                    ],
                ],
                'variant' => [
                    'data' => [
                        'type' => 'variants',
                        'id' => (string) $variant,
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ])->json();
}
```

### Example for Single Variant Products

```php
// Cache products forever, to not do API request on each visit of the page
// Make sure to clear the cache after each deployment or when something changes in Product data

$products = Cache::rememberForever('lemonsqueezy-products', static fn () => app(LemonSqueezyService::class)->products());

$products = collect($products['data'])
// exclude non-published
$products->filter(fn ($product) => $product['attributes']['status'] === 'published')
    // Sort them by price
    ->sortByDesc(fn ($product) => $product['attributes']['price'])
    ->map(function ($product) {
        $attributes = $product['attributes'];
        // LemonSqueezy as other payment providers saves price in cents,
        // so dividing it to 100 to get USD
        $price = (int) $attributes['price'] / 100;

        $plan = match ($attributes['name']) {
            'Starter' => 'starter',
            default => 'unlimited'
        };

        return [
            'name' => $attributes['name'],
            'slug' => $attributes['slug'],
            'plan' => $plan,
            'price' => $price,
            'bestseller' => $plan === 'unlimited',
            'discounted_price' => $price - 100,
            'url' => $attributes['buy_now_url'].'?checkout%5Bdiscount_code%5D=LAUNCH10OFF',
            // I keep all plan features in config files and load them dynamically based on plan slug
            'features' => config('plans.' . $plan . '.features')
        ];
    });
```

Use `$products` variable in your view files to display pricing tables
