Larafast uses [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). Feel free to modify, add and use any components from DaisyUI or TailwindCSS.&#x20;

DaisyUI supports 32 themes, which are pre-installed out of the box, to read more about themes check here: [https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/)

To modify theme, add data-theme="...themename..." to `resources/views/app.blade.php` file

```php app.blade.php
<html data-theme="light" class="scroll-smooth">
```

All the components are located in `/recources/views/liveview`... folder and their respective class file in `/app/Livewire`... folder.

To create a new Page add it to the `resources/views/pages` folder.

To create a new Component add it to the `resources/views/components` folder or if it's a Livewire component use `php artisan make:livewire ComponentName` command.
