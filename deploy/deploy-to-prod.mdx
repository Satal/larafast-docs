1. Create your GitHub repo and push changes&#x20;
2. Buy a hosting provider. I use [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/2711f3f9172a) as it has very cheap options and is easily scalable whenever needed
3. Setup you .env with production keys for [Stripe](features/payments/stripe.md) or [LemonSqueezy](features/payments/lemonsqueezy.md)
4. Add Payment Webhooks for Prod
5. Turn off "Test Mode" for Stripe or LemonSqueezy

```
composer install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan make:admin // to create admin user
npm install
npm run build
```

And you are good to go.

## Deploying with Laravel Forge

1. Create a new server on Forge
2. Add your SSH key to the server
3. Add your domain to the server
4. Add your GitHub repo to the server
5. Deploy the project

### Deployment script for Laravel Forge

```bash
cd /home/forge/YOUR_PROJECT_PATH

git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/$FORGE_SITE_BRANCH
$FORGE_COMPOSER install --no-dev --no-interaction --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader

( flock -w 10 9 || exit 1
    echo 'Restarting FPM...'; sudo -S service $FORGE_PHP_FPM reload ) 9>/tmp/fpmlock

if [ -f artisan ]; then
    $FORGE_PHP artisan migrate --force
fi

php artisan cache:clear
php artisan generate:sitemap

npm install
npm run build
```

Deployment examples via Envoyer will be provided soon.
