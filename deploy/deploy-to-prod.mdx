1. Create your GitHub repo and push changes&#x20;
2. Buy a hosting provider. I use [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/2711f3f9172a) as it has very cheap options and is easily scalable whenever needed
3. Setup you .env with production keys for [Stripe](features/payments/stripe.md) or [LemonSqueezy](features/payments/lemonsqueezy.md)
4. Add Payment Webhooks for Prod
5. Turn off "Test Mode" for Stripe or LemonSqueezy

```
composer install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan make:admin // to create admin user
npm install
npm run build
```

And you are good to go.
